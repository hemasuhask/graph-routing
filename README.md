# Graph Routing

## Project Introduction
This project involves implementing a routing service that represents the United States highway network as a graph and calculates routes and distances on this network. It consists of two main parts: implementing GraphProcessor to manage the graph representation and creating GraphDemo to demonstrate the functionality of GraphProcessor with a minimal viable product. The project emphasizes understanding graph theory, algorithm implementation, and testing methodologies.
